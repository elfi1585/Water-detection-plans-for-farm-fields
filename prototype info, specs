Prototype specs
For our prototype, we were aiming to test different sensors and how they worked, with both the arduino and the raspberry pi.
However, shipping got delayed and we could not get the wanted sensors in time. We then had to order a cheaper sensor from
Amazon. Thus, we were limited in what we were able to test. However, we were able to experiment with the raspberry pi and the arduino,
and we used a mix of both in our prototype in order to read the data two different ways, using analog and digital.

For constructing our prototype, we had to put an operating system on an sd card from scratch, as the operating system we wanted was not
a common operating system. We also had to install several programs onto the raspberry pi, and then on both the raspberry pi and arduino we had 
to write a program that would read the moisture level at one second intervals so that the scroll wouldn't be to fast, and it would be readable.
We then just had to connect the moisture sensor to the appropriate pins on the arduino and raspberry pi.

Some advantages of our protoype were:
-It was easily portable. You could easily grab your computer and the sensor and carry it to different parts of the field in order to get instant/live readings.
-The user could choose whether or not to use the system from the raspberry pi or the arduino.

Some disadvantages of our prototype were:
-If using a raspberry pi, it would be difficult to find a power source to power the system, especially in an open field, where you would want it to be portable.
-We did not have any casing, so you could not leave it in a field because all the parts would be very vulnerable to the surroundings.
-Since we did not get the parts until late, we were pressed for time, which made the build stressful.
-The sensor we had was not very sensitive, and so it would not read pure water as 100% moisture, and it would not give a digital output of zero.
