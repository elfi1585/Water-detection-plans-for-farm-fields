Critical Component:
	Our critical components are the waterproof encasement and the piping of our device. We chose these to be our critical components
because they are what separates our device from other moisture sensors. Other moisture sensors are often used for indoor watering
of plants, or just briefly used outside in the garden. Our device will have to withstand weather from being left outside for
extended periods of time, and also the flood of water that comes from actually flood irrigating the farm. It will also have to
get deep underground instead of how most moisture sensors just are reading the surface of the soil. Our critical components serve
these purposes; the waterproof encasement protects the Raspberry Pi and LCD screen from weather and the flood irrigation, and the
pipes allow the moisture sensors to get to the required depths and also are high enough that the flood irrigation won't flow
into the pipes and mess up the moisture reading.
	The pieces necessary for our critical components were a total of 20' of PVC pipe (~$10), Adafruit waterproof encasement for
Raspberry Pi (~$20), O-rings that we made from recycled bicycle tires, and a stand made from scrap wood. The prices of our critical
components add up to be around $30.
	This leaves us with just a little bit of coding left to do until our device is complete. We will be doing tests often until our
device is perfected.
